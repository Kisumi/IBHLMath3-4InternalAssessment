# IB HL Math 3-4: Internal Assessment
## Elaine Yang

	>>> This is where I have compiled the source code for quicksort, merge sort, and insertion sort.
	>>> They only demonstrate the algorithm, since what I am testing for is algorithm efficiency. Don't expect a fancy GUI or anything.
	>>> To compile a java source code, type into the command line:
		$ javac [name of source code].java
	>>> To execute a compiled java program, type into the command line:
		$ java [name of class file that contains the main method after compilation]
	>>> To see how much time each algorithm takes to run, compile their source code and type into the command line:
		$ time [name of class file] numbers
	>>> NOTE: "time" is a Bash command, so it will only work on systems that support Bash.
	>>> The file named "numbers" contains 10,000 random numbers seperated by spaces. The array of numbers to sort is one of the main control variables in this investigation.
	>>> When executing the programs, never forget to include "numbers" after the file names, or else the programs will not know what to sort and throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. Not pleasant.
	>>> Thanks for reading the README.
