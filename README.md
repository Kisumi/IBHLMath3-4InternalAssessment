# IB HL Math 3-4: Internal Assessment

	>>> This is where I have compiled the source code for quicksort, merge sort, and insertion sort.
	>>> They only demonstrate the algorithm, since what I am testing for is algorithm efficiency.
	>>> To see how much time each algorithm takes to run, compile their source code and type this into the command line:
		$ time [name of the compiled file here] numbers
	>>> The file named "numbers" contains 10,000 random numbers seperated by spaces.
	>>> When executing the programs, do not forget to include "numbers" after the file name, or else it will not know what to sort.
	>>> Thanks for reading the README.
