# IB HL Math 3-4: Internal Assessment

	>>> This is where I have compiled the source code for quicksort, merge sort, and insertion sort.
	>>> They only demonstrate the algorithm, since what I am testing for is algorithm efficiency.
	>>> To see how much time each algorithm takes to run, compile the source code for the one you want to see and type this into the command line:
		$ time [name of the compiled file here]
	>>> Thanks for reading the README.
